# External Communication on Meaningful Living

## Purpose
In all external communications, we aim to emphasize the importance of a meaningful life as a central part of our policies. Our vision is to create a society where people feel valued, appreciated, and engaged. By highlighting the role of meaningfulness in societal development, we can illustrate how our political decisions, community building, and legislation contribute to creating a better life for everyone.

## Examples and Practical Approaches
- **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**: A concrete example of how our policies contribute to a meaningful life by providing individuals with the financial freedom to choose fulfilling activities, develop themselves, and engage in society in ways that strengthen community and social cohesion.
- **Positive View on Work and Contributions to Society**: In communications about AUBI and other initiatives, we can highlight examples of how people can contribute to society in ways that are meaningful to them—ranging from volunteer work and creative projects to starting social initiatives or sharing their knowledge and experiences with others.

## Communication Strategy
- Use social media, press releases, and public events to showcase stories of people who have found purpose through our initiatives and policy changes.
- Strengthen connections with local communities through workshops and dialogues where meaningful living is discussed and grounded, which also enhances our presence and proposals in local contexts.
- Be clear and inclusive in our communication to show that a meaningful life is accessible to everyone, regardless of background or life situation.
