### 4.1.5 Meaningful Existence as a Social Right

---

#### Introduction
Modern social and economic systems tend to focus on individual material welfare and productivity rather than subjective well-being and a sense of meaning in life. Our party views a meaningful existence as a fundamental right, just as essential as physical protection, education, and economic security. We believe that a meaningful existence is a prerequisite for a healthy, balanced society in which individuals can thrive and develop sustainably.

#### Vision
We believe every individual has the right to a life where they feel a sense of belonging, can contribute with their unique abilities, and where societal structures support them in finding and developing their personal sense of meaning. This entails creating a social structure that gives people space and support for self-realization and personal growth.
