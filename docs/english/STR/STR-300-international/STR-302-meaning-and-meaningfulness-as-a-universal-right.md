# International Strategy: Meaning and Meaningfulness as a Universal Right

## Introduction
We believe that meaning and meaningfulness are fundamental human rights that contribute to individuals' well-being and create a more sustainable and equitable global society. By promoting meaning and meaningfulness as part of welfare policy and social structures, Sweden can be a role model for other countries. This strategy document outlines how Sweden can lead an international movement to recognize meaning and meaningfulness as universal rights, and how this can strengthen international cooperation and peace.

## Vision and Goals
Our vision is for meaning and meaningfulness to be globally recognized as part of human rights and to become an inherent part of national policy and social planning. We aim to:
1. Establish meaning and meaningfulness as essential components of welfare and societal structures.
2. Promote international collaborations based on shared values concerning the individual’s worth and society’s responsibility to provide space for meaning in every citizen’s life.
3. Strengthen Sweden’s position as a global advocate for meaning, meaningfulness, and human development.

## Strategic Goals and Approaches

### 1. Recognizing Meaning and Meaningfulness as a Universal Right
   - **UN and International Organizations**: Work to include meaning and meaningfulness as part of human rights by raising the issue in the UN General Assembly, UNDP, and other international organizations.
   - **Global Declaration on Meaningfulness**: Initiate efforts toward an international declaration on meaning and meaningfulness, affirming that all people have the right to a meaningful existence, regardless of country or living standards.

### 2. Sweden as a Role Model
   - **National Framework for Meaning and Meaningfulness**: By implementing a framework in Sweden on how meaning and meaningfulness can be integrated into welfare policy, Sweden can become an inspiration for other nations.
   - **International Platform for Meaning and Meaningfulness**: Establish a platform for countries to exchange experiences and strategies on how meaning and meaningfulness can be promoted in societies, with Sweden as the host and initiator.

### 3. Promoting International Cooperation and Peace
   - **Meaning and Meaningfulness as a Basis for Peace and Diplomacy**: Promote the integration of meaning and meaningfulness in diplomatic relations and conflict resolution. Meaningfulness can create a stronger foundation for understanding and respect among nations, thus contributing to more peaceful relations.
   - **Development Assistance Focused on Meaning and Meaningfulness**: Adapt Swedish development assistance programs to include projects aimed at providing individuals and communities with conditions for a meaningful existence. This may include education, health, and social initiatives that reinforce meaning and meaningfulness.

### 4. Meaning and Meaningfulness as Part of Sustainable Development
   - **SDG (Sustainable Development Goals)**: Advocate for the integration of meaning and meaningfulness within the UN’s sustainable development goals. This means that Sweden will actively promote the inclusion of meaning and meaningfulness in goals related to health, education, and economic equality.
   - **Environment and Meaningfulness**: Highlight the connection between environmental care and meaning and meaningfulness in international environmental contexts, where individuals feel engaged and have the opportunity to contribute to a sustainable future.

## Communication Strategy
   - **International Campaigns and Events**: Organize international campaigns and conferences to spread the message about meaning and meaningfulness as universal rights and Sweden’s role in championing this vision.
   - **Partnerships with Civil Society**: Collaborate with global organizations, non-profits, and academic institutions to strengthen the standing of meaning and meaningfulness internationally.

## Implementation and Monitoring
Implementing this strategy requires continuous dialogue with international partners and regular follow-up. Sweden should, for example, initiate an annual report on the global status of meaning and meaningfulness and analyze the development of meaningfulness initiatives in various parts of the world.

## Conclusion
By emphasizing meaning and meaningfulness as a human right, Sweden can become a global leader in a new, humane, and inclusive approach to welfare policy and social structure. We believe that a society where everyone is given the opportunity to live meaningful lives forms the foundation for both national and international peace, justice, and sustainable development.
