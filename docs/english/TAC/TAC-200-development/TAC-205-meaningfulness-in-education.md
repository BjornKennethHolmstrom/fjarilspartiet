# 4.2.4 Meaningfulness in Education

## Introduction
The purpose of education should extend beyond merely preparing students for working life; it should also prepare them for meaningful social engagement and a fulfilling personal life. We emphasize that education’s goals include helping students find a deeper sense of meaning in their own role in society, inspiring engagement, a sense of community, and social responsibility.

## Goals
This section of the educational framework aims to promote:
1. Democratic participation by educating students in social engagement and critical thinking.
2. Personal and social development as part of the holistic approach of education.
3. Opportunities for students to explore their own values, interests, and roles in a broader social context.

## Methods and Implementation
- **Integrated Democratic Education**: Introduce programs and courses that strengthen the understanding of democratic participation and collective responsibility.
- **Projects and Collaborative Opportunities**: Encourage project-based learning focused on meaningful social issues, allowing students to contribute and learn in real-world contexts.
- **Guidance and Support for Self-Realization**: Provide students with access to mentors and advisors who can support them in discovering and developing their interests, talents, and ways to contribute to society.
