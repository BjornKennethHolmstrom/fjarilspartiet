# Hybrid Governance Framework
## Unity Forward (Enhet Fram√•t)

### Core Philosophy

Our governance model recognizes that different situations require different approaches to decision-making and action. Rather than forcing all decisions through a single process, we adapt our governance to the context while maintaining democratic legitimacy and accountability.

### Foundational Principles

1. **Contextual Governance**
   - Different situations require different approaches
   - Form follows function
   - Scale-appropriate decision making
   - Balance between efficiency and participation

2. **Democratic Foundation**
   - All power ultimately derives from membership
   - Regular renewal of mandates
   - Transparent processes
   - Clear accountability

3. **Adaptive Learning**
   - Regular evaluation of outcomes
   - Process refinement based on evidence
   - Integration of member feedback
   - Continuous improvement

     - Direct responsibility
     - Experimental approach

### Integration Mechanisms
