Suggested Pilot Projects (these would be realistic to start small-scale):

1. **"Växthuset" - Local Food & Community Hub**
- Small-scale implementation of local food systems
- Community garden + learning space
- Could start in one neighborhood/kommun
- Tests aspects of both sustainability and community building
- Could integrate with AUBI by providing opportunities for meaningful contribution

2. **"DemDel" - Democratic Deliberation Project**
- Small-scale test of DidiS in a specific context (e.g., neighborhood planning)
- Combines digital tools with physical meetings
- Could partner with an interested kommun
- Tests both technical platform and democratic processes

3. **"LärLab" - Learning Laboratory**
- Small-scale implementation of MU principles
- Could start as after-school program or study circle
- Integrates mysticism, philosophy, and practical learning
- Tests educational transformation ideas in practice

These pilot projects are:
1. Manageable in scale
2. Test core concepts
3. Could start with minimal resources
4. Would provide valuable learning experiences
5. Could grow organically if successful
